# Roblox Executor Mac – Download Free for Mac

![Roblox Executor Mac](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05904bac-2c42-41e2-8f91-e36dcc06e998)

This is a tool that allows players to run custom scripts in Roblox games. These scripts can modify gameplay, automate actions, or introduce new features not originally part of the game. While scripting can be used for creative and educational purposes, it's worth noting that exploiting games or violating Roblox's Terms of Service can lead to account bans.
